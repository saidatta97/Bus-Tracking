Bus Tracking App
Problem Statement: During Bus travelling specially for local and kadamba buses there is no system to track live location of bus (exact timing when bus will arrive). Some new passengers also do not have any idea of bus scheduling and availability of bus. This app will help passengers to get information of arrival and availability of buses in particular locations.

Solution: We will develop an app that will be on drivers or conductors phones which will tell the live location and updates of the bus. Driver or conductor will first register and will upload bus details of their bus. Then our app will use Driver or conductors mobile location to track exact live location of Bus and Machine learning Algorithm will tell the exact time of bus arrival on passengers location.

Passengers: Passengers will register and give permission to the app and also passengers will tell their destination. And according to their destination app will show the list of buses traveling to passengers' destinations from this location. He can select any one bus and can see its live location and estimated arrival time
